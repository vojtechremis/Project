In this experiment, we start with a function which is sum of 5 gausian peaks.

```latex
f(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} 	ext{peak}(x, y, x_i, y_i, A_i)
```

where \(	ext{peak}(x, y, x_i, y_i, A_i, S_i)\) is a Gaussian function defined as follows:

```latex
	ext{peak}(x, y, x_i, y_i, A_i, S_i) = A_i \cdot \exp\left(-\left((x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2ight)\cdot S_iight)
```
